Ray does the intros

[RAY]_

    OK, there's no one else here. Looks like they've left me to supervise you on my
    own.

    Mrs Sheppey, you and Martin have a longer visit today while we're conducting an
    inspection of the cell.

    |HERO|, I'm going to ask you into the Guard's Office in a moment. Please wait
    right here while I open up.

    Oooh, we can choose our own table today!

    No, this one's ours.
