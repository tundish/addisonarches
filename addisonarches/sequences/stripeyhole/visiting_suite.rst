First positions

[RAY]_

    OK, there's no one else here. Looks like they've left me to supervise you on my
    own.

    Mrs Sheppey, you and Martin have a longer visit today while we're conducting an
    inspection of the cell.

    |HERO|, I'm going to ask you into the Guard's Office in a moment. Please wait
    right here while I open up.

[KAREN]_

    Oooh, we can choose our own table today!

[MARTIN]_

    No, this one's ours.


Karen talks of the journey

[KAREN]_

    I don't like visiting time so early. There's traffic now on the M2.

[MARTIN]_

    Yeah.

[KAREN]_

    But it's not so bad later on.

[MARTIN]_

    No.

[KAREN]_

    Mid morning's okay. I sometimes go with the girls for lunch at Farthing Corner.

    Which is nice.

[MARTIN]_

    Oh.

[KAREN]_

    I really don't know why they had to move you up here. Standford Hill was much
    easier.

[MARTIN]_

    Yeah, easier, but...

[KAREN]_

    And this place is full of hard nuts. Why did they think you belonged here? You were
    close to coming out, too.

[MARTIN]_

    No, it's...

    A shame.

Karen talks of her work
-----------------------

:frame:

[KAREN]_

    Mandy left, so I've got the chair by the window now.

[MARTIN]_

    Yeah.

[KAREN]_

    Which I like, but in the summer you get the sun right on you.

    When the drier's on that's too much.

[MARTIN]_

    Yeah.

[KAREN]_

    And wintertime the cold comes straight through the glass.

    So I have my cardie.

[MARTIN]_

    Oh.

[KAREN]_

    And you get the wind through the door.

[MARTIN]_

    No.

[KAREN]_

    And I keep my bag in the back and it's further away now and I can't see it from
    where I am.

[MARTIN]_

    Yep.


[KAREN]_

    But I do like it.

    Mandy had it all the time she was there so fair's fair.


[MARTIN]_

    So now you're working at the fair?


[KAREN]_

    No, |MARTIN| I work at Sandy Hair.

    Next to the fair.

[MARTIN]_

    I thought you said you worked at the fair.

    Did they sack you from the cleaning?

[KAREN]_

    No, I still do the cleaning.
