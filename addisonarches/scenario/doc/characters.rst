Characters
::::::::::

Frankie Drum
============

We never see Frankie Drum. It's never clear whether any of our characters
have ever met him/her. We don't know how old Frankie is or what gender.
The pronoun here is `he` for convenience.

Frankie is a powerful and controlling presence in the game. A benefactor,
avenging angel, a threat and a destructive force. Capable of arranging
anything, good or bad.

Frankie is a myth shared by all characters in the game. All characters
derive their power from him and/or are under some sort of obligation to him.

Frankie's role is to justify pre-existing relationships and imperatives.
You're looking after the business for Frankie. You owe Frankie money.
Frankie won't like it if you do such-and-such. You can't take that, it
belongs to Frankie.

Aideen is the proprietor of a scrapyard and other businesses which she
inherited from her father. She is capable and ambitious and can draw on

Barry Lattimer
==============

Barry Lattimer is a single man in middle age. He runs the
Goldhawk Tavern.

Barry did not do well at school. He joined the army in his teenage
years. It was there he took up boxing. When he returned to civilian
life he began to compete and took part in several professional fights.

He worked in the security industry for a while before the sad death
of his mother provided the means to become the landlord of a pub.

Barry is a shy man. He feels most secure in a male group where he can
hide from his lack of confidence around women. He is sensitive and
thoughtful, but easily misled.

Barry breeds rabbits and sells them with hutches he makes himself.
He hears much gossip but is often mistaken about its significance.
