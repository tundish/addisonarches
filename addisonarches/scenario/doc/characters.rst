Ali and Rashid Khan
===================

The point of these two characters is to put the player in the situation of a
Picaresque_. Escapades are celebrated. Themes are repeated. Satire is applied.

Ideas for absurdism, clowning, breaking the fourth wall:

* `Statler and Waldorf`_ of the Muppet Show
* Musketeer Juniper from `How I Won the War`_.
* The narrator's voice in the book `History of Tom Jones, a Foundling`_.
