Characters
::::::::::

Frankie Drum
============

We never see Frankie Drum. It's never clear whether any of our characters
have ever met him/her. We don't know how old Frankie is or what gender.
The pronoun here is `he` for convenience.

Frankie is a powerful and controlling presence in the game. A benefactor,
avenging angel, a threat and a destructive force. Capable of arranging
anything, good or bad.

Frankie is a myth shared by all characters in the game. All characters
derive their power from him and/or are under some sort of obligation to him.

Frankie's role is to justify pre-existing relationships and imperatives.
You're looking after the business for Frankie. You owe Frankie money.
Frankie won't like it if you do such-and-such. You can't take that, it
belongs to Frankie.

Aideen Price
============

Aideen is the proprietor of a scrapyard and other businesses which she
inherited from her father. She is capable and ambitious and can draw on
support from family and business associates.

She regularly provides challenges and objectives for the player. She can also
act antagonistically and place the player in peril.

Picaresque_. Escapades are celebrated. Themes are repeated. Satire is applied.
The game can continue without end.

Ideas for absurdism, clowning, breaking the fourth wall:
